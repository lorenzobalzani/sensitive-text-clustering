        "## Problem statement\n",
        "Given a dataset where each sentence (by human judgment) provides some sensitive personal information about a person, write an ML algorithm that clusters data into different types of sensitive personal information and automatically assigns a label to each cluster.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use Jupyter notebook and Python 3.X.\n",

        "Hints:\n",
        "* focus on SOTA approaches, try to avoid ancient technology if there is a better one.\n",

        "### GPU usage\n",
        "I have chosen to use Google Colab because a GPU is freely available. Hence, it will be assumed that a GPU is available. If not, some packages might either not work (CuML) or be slower (BERTopic). You can fix this by using the *standard* package versions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Visualizations\n",
        "All the visualizations (both interactive and static) cannot be appropriately rendered in the notebook. Therefore, you might want to re-run the notebook to get them.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Fine-tuned model\n",
        "If you are not keen to re-train the model, download the `sensitive-text-clustering` model from the [HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/balzanilo/sensitive-text-clustering)."

        ">The great advantage of passing custom labels to BERTopic is that when more accurate zero-shot are released, we can simply use those on top of BERTopic to further fine-tune the labeling. For example, let's say you have a set of potential topic labels that you want to use instead of the ones generated by BERTopic. You could use the `bart-large-mnli` model to find which user-defined labels best represent the BERTopic-generated labels:\n",

        ">The topic model will be much more attuned to the categories that were defined previously. However, this does not mean that only topics for these categories will be found. BERTopic is likely to find more specific topics in those you have already defined. This allows you to discover previously unknown topics!\n",
        "6. The main problem of BERTopic - as discussed in this GitHub issue [4] - is that it mainly relies on the selected clustering scheme, but the latter is not optimized to select the best hyperparameters (e.g. cluster number). A possibile solution is TopicTuner [5].\n",

        ">A straightforward way is to first apply a dimensionality reduction technique to the original embedding space $H$ to obtain the aforementioned latent space $Z$, and subsequently apply clustering algorithms to $Z$ for obtaining the latent space clusters representing topics. However, such a naive approach cannot guarantee that the reduced-dimension embeddings will be naturally suited for clustering, given that no clustering promoting objective is incorporated in the dimensionality reduction step. Therefore, we propose to jointly learn the latent space projection and cluster in the latent space instead of conducting them one after another, so that the latent representation learning is guided by the clustering objective, and the cluster quality benefits from the well-separated structure of the latent space, achieving a mutually-enhanced effect. Such joint learning is realized by training a generative model that connects the latent topic structure with the original space representations.\n",
